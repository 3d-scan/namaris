  /** \brief @b RegionGrowing Performs region growing segmentation on a
   * pointcloud using a user-defined condition function.
   * 
   * Given a point in the cloud it's neighboring points are found. For all of 
   * them a two conditions are verified:
   *  1) unary condition determining if a neighboring point is a valid candidate
   *  2) binary condition between the original point and a neighboring point 
   *  determining if they make a valid pair
   * 
   * If the fraction of neighbors satisfying the unary constraint is larger than
   * a threshold and the fraction of neighbors satisfying the binary constraint 
   * is larger than (a different) threshold neighboring points satisfying both 
   * conditions are added to the cluster. The same procedure is run on the newly
   * added points. Once this process converges it is run again on the remaining points in the 
   * cloud (i.e. points that were not yet assigned to any cluster).
