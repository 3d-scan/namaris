  /** \brief @b RegionGrowingSmoothness Performs region growing
   * segmentation on a pointcloud using a surface normal smoothness constraint. 
   * This is essintially a @b RegionGrowing class with a predefined binary
   * condition function.
   * 
   * Given a point in the cloud it's neighboring points are found. For all of 
   * them a two conditions are verified:
   *  1) unary condition determining if a neighboring point is a valid candidate
   *  (can bes specified by the user)
   *  2) binary condition between the original point and a neighboring point. 
   *  Points belong to the same cluster if the angle between their surface
   *  normals is smaller than a user specified threshold.
   * 
   * If the fraction of neighbors satisfying the unary constraint is larger than
   * a threshold and the fraction of neighbors satisfying the binary constraint 
   * is larger than (a different) threshold neighboring points satisfying both 
   * conditions are added to the cluster. The same procedure is run on the newly
   * added points. Once this process converges it is run again on the remaining
   * points in the cloud (i.e. points that were not yet assigned to any cluster)
   * .
